You might have already heard my earlier release of [Pallavi](/blog/pallavi/) in Raga Bilaskhani Todi. The cover notes to the release also talks about the Raga, the story behind its name etc. In case you havent read the cover notes, you can read about it [here](/blog/r16-bilaskhani-todi).

In my opinion, [Raga Alapana](/blog/raga-alapana/) is one of the most challenging aspects of Indian classical music. This is because the slow pace of a Raga exploration demands very precise presentation of phrases, swaras, samvads, intonations etc. Every error feels magnified because the brain has the time to process the music. A faster paced music can sometimes mask errors because by the time the brain processes one musical phrase, few more have already come in! 

This gets even more tricky when one is dealing with Ragas which have the same scale but a distinctly different musical identity. Raga Bilaskhani Todi, Raga Bhairavi and Raga Komal Rishabh Asavari all have the same scale, and yet have a very different flavor, structure and emotional content. The challenge in Raga Alapana is to keep the unique identity of each of these Ragas while presenting them. You can find the link to Raga Alapana in Komal Rishabh Asavari in the Release Links section below. Listen to the two Ragas. What do you think? I hope to release Alapana in Raga Bhairavi as well in due course.

One of the hallmarks of traditional Indian classical music presentation is an extended Raga Alapana. In this track, I present an extensive Raga Alapana in Raga Bilaskhani Todi.  Enjoy!

## Program Notes

### Raga Alapana in Raga Bilaskhani Todi
Raga [Alapana](/blog/raga-alapana/) is an improvisation and a systematic presentation of a Raga.  Usually, it has three parts - Alap, Jod and Jhala. This format is also known as Ragam and Tanam. Raga Alapana generally has no rhythmic accompaniment, but occasionally, we perform Jod or Jhala or both to the accompaniment of a percussion instrument.

Here are some notes about the Raga.

**Raga** - Bilaskhani Todi

**Scale** - Sa re ga ma Pa dha ni

**Family** - Todi

**Melakarta** - Hanumatodi (Sa re ga ma Pa dha ni)

**Prahar** - 1st prahar (equivalent to 6 AM - 9 AM)

### Reading the scale
In Indian Classical Music, the seven notes in an octave are called Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni and then Sa comes again. Notes with a capitalised first letter are called Tivra (or sharp) notes. This scale does not have any Tivar notes. Notes written fully in lower case are called Komal (or flat) notes. E.g., re and ga above. Sa and Pa are always written with a capitalized first letter.

### Prahar
In Indian Classical Music, Ragas are classified into Prahars (time periods of a day or night) which are said to represent the most appropriate time to perform the Raga.
