A "farmaish" is a request. In Indian classical music forums and concerts, it is not ununusual for a fan/patron to request the artist for a specific musical piece rendition. Raga Hamir Kalyan was a farmaish by a dear friend and patron. Given the complex nature of the Raga (more on that below), it has taken me some time to understand and render this Raga.

Raga Hamir Kalyan is a beautiful late evening/early night Raga. This is also called Amir Kalyani in the Carnatic musical tradtion. In common nomenclature, this Raga is classified as a "Jod" or a combination Raga. It means that it combines the melodic form of Raga Hamir and Raga Kalyan to form Raga Hamir Kalyan. Often "Jod" Ragas are rendered in its individual form, as in Raga 1 in aroha, Raga 2 avaroha or vice versa. In my opinion, Jod Ragas are and can be quite complex and difficult to render because though they take melodic forms of 2 Ragas, the final rendering has to have its own distinct identity. Even among these, Raga Hamir Kalyan has other complexities. Lets look at the scale:

**Scale** - Sa Re Ga ma Ma Pa Dha ni Ni SA (Please refer to the Program Notes below for the notation.)

As you can see, there are two sets of 3 semi-tone intervals - `Ga ma Ma Pa` and `Dha ni Ni SA`. While such consecutive intervals may be common in folk music or in Jazz/Blues etc, this is a bit unusual in Indian classical music Ragas. The challenge therefore arises, how does one use these consecutive intervals? How does one navigate through all these intervals to create a form, shape and identity for Hamir Kalyan? This is where a deep understanding of Lakshanas and Lakshyas[https://www.chandraveena.com/blog/grammar-of-music/] come in handy.

In this presentation of *Raga Hamir Kalyan* on Chandraveena, I explore the Raga in Alap, Jod and Jhala, followed by a Composition in Chautala (12 beats). I am accompanied on Pakhawaj by **Shri Dhaval Mistry** for the Pallavi session. 

Shri Dhaval Mistry is a young and accomplished Pakhawaj player coming from a family of musical instrument makers. Dhaval Mistry has been learning and continues to be under the guidance of the master Pakhwaj player **Shri Manik Munde**.

  If you have a request/farmaish, do write to me. If its within my purview and understanding, I will try to render and publish it some time. Thanks.

## Program Notes

### Raga Alapana in Hamir Kalyan
Raga [Alapana](/blog/raga-alapana/) is an improvisation and a systematic presentation of a Raga. This part has no rhythmic accompaniment. It has three parts - Alap, Jod and Jhala. This format is also known as Ragam and Tanam.

Here are some notes about the Raga.

**Raga** - Hamir Kalyan

**Scale** - Sa Re Ga ma Ma Pa Dha ni Ni

**Family** - Kalyan

**Melakarta** - Bhashanga Janya of Mechakalyani (Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni)

**Prahar** - 5th prahar (equivalent to 6 PM - 9 PM)

### Reading the scale
In Indian Classical Music, the seven notes in an octave are called Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni and then Sa comes again. Notes with a capitalised first letter are called Tivra (or sharp) notes. E.g., Re above. Notes written fully in lower case are called Komal (or flat) notes. E.g., ma and ni above. Sa and Pa are always written with a capitalized first letter.

### Bhashanga Raga

A Bhashanga Raga is a Janya (or derivative) Raga of a Melakarta which uses a note/s outside of the Melakarta notes. In this raga, ma and ni are outside of Kalyani.

### Prahar
In Indian Classical Music, Ragas are classified into Prahars (time periods of a day or night) which are said to represent the most appropriate time to perform the Raga.

### Pallavi in Chautala in Raga Malkauns
[Pallavi](/blog/pallavi/) also known as *Bandish*, *Gat*, *Kriti* or composition is a melodic line (or lines) bound by a [Tala](/blog/taladhyaya) or rhythmic cycle. In some cases, lyrics are set to a melody in the chosen Raga and Tala, whereas in other cases it is just a melodic line with no lyrical or literary meaning, called *Swarajati* or *Gat*. Many instrumental compositions use the latter format, to make the most of "playing" with the rhythm.

### About the Tala
Chautala has 12 beats split as 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 denoted by solfas or syllables representing various rhythmic patterns. The basic solfas of Chautala are given below.

**Tala** - Chautala

**Beats** - 12 (4+4+2+2)

**Solfas** - Dha Dha Dhin Ta | KiTa Dha Dhin Ta | ThiTa KatTa | GaDhi GaNa |
