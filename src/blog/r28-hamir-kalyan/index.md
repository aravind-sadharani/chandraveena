In the tradition of Indian classical music, it is not ununusual for a fan or a patron to request an artist to perform a specific Raga or a specific musical composition. Raga Hamir Kalyan was a *farmaish* (request) by a dear friend and patron. Due to the complex nature of the Raga (more on that below), it has taken me some time to understand and render this Raga.

Raga Hamir Kalyan is a beautiful late evening or early night Raga. This is also called Amir Kalyani in the Carnatic musical tradtion. In common nomenclature, this Raga is classified as a *Jod* or a combination Raga. It means that the melodic forms of Raga Hamir and Raga Kalyan are combined to form Raga Hamir Kalyan.

Often Jod Ragas are rendered using the constituent Ragas, like Raga 1 in *aroha*, Raga 2 in *avaroha* or vice versa. In my opinion, Jod Ragas are quite complex and difficult to render because though they use the melodic forms of two Ragas, the final rendering has to have its own distinct identity. Even among these, Raga Hamir Kalyan has other complexities. Let us look at the scale:

**Scale** - **Sa Re Ga ma Ma Pa Dha ni Ni SA** (see Program Notes below for the notation)

As you can see, there are two sets of 3 semi-tone intervals - **Ga ma Ma Pa** and **Dha ni Ni SA**. While such consecutive intervals may be common in folk music or in Jazz or Blues, this is a bit unusual in Indian classical music Ragas. The challenge that arises then, is how to use these consecutive intervals. How does one navigate through all these intervals to create a form, shape and identity for Hamir Kalyan? This is where a deep understanding of [Lakshanas and Lakshyas](/blog/grammar-of-music/) is necessary.

In this presentation of *Raga Hamir Kalyan* on Chandraveena, I explore the Raga in Alap, Jod and Jhala, followed by a Composition in Chautala (12 beats). I am accompanied on Pakhawaj by **Shri Dhaval Mistry** for the Pallavi session. 

Shri Dhaval Mistry is a young and accomplished Pakhawaj player coming from a family of musical instrument makers. Dhaval Mistry has been learning and continues to be under the guidance of the master Pakhwaj player **Shri Manik Munde**.

If you have a farmaish or request, do write to me. If it is within my purview and understanding, I will perform and publish it at some time. Thank you.

## Program Notes

### Raga Alapana in Hamir Kalyan
Raga [Alapana](/blog/raga-alapana/) is an improvisation and a systematic presentation of a Raga. This part has no rhythmic accompaniment. It has three parts - Alap, Jod and Jhala. This format is also known as Ragam and Tanam.

Here are some notes about the Raga.

**Raga** - Hamir Kalyan

**Scale** - Sa Re Ga ma Ma Pa Dha ni Ni

**Family** - Kalyan

**Melakarta** - Bhashanga Janya of Mechakalyani (Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni)

**Prahar** - 5th prahar (equivalent to 6 PM - 9 PM)

### Reading the scale
In Indian Classical Music, the seven notes in an octave are called Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni and then Sa comes again. Notes with a capitalised first letter are called Tivra (or sharp) notes. E.g., Re above. Notes written fully in lower case are called Komal (or flat) notes. E.g., ma and ni above. Sa and Pa are always written with a capitalized first letter.

### Bhashanga Raga

A Bhashanga Raga is a Janya (or derivative) Raga of a Melakarta which uses a note/s outside of the Melakarta notes. In this raga, ma and ni are outside of Kalyani.

### Prahar
In Indian Classical Music, Ragas are classified into Prahars (time periods of a day or night) which are said to represent the most appropriate time to perform the Raga.

### Pallavi in Chautala in Raga Malkauns
[Pallavi](/blog/pallavi/) also known as *Bandish*, *Gat*, *Kriti* or composition is a melodic line (or lines) bound by a [Tala](/blog/taladhyaya) or rhythmic cycle. In some cases, lyrics are set to a melody in the chosen Raga and Tala, whereas in other cases it is just a melodic line with no lyrical or literary meaning, called *Swarajati* or *Gat*. Many instrumental compositions use the latter format, to make the most of "playing" with the rhythm.

### About the Tala
Chautala has 12 beats split as 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 denoted by solfas or syllables representing various rhythmic patterns. The basic solfas of Chautala are given below.

**Tala** - Chautala

**Beats** - 12 (4+4+2+2)

**Solfas** - Dha Dha Dhin Ta | KiTa Dha Dhin Ta | ThiTa KatTa | GaDhi GaNa |
