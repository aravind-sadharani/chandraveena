*Raga Hamsadhwani* is a very popular Raga across India in both North Indian and South Indian classical music forms. You may have heard an extermely popular *Kriti* (lyrical composition) in Raga Hamsadhwani - **Vatapi Ganapatim Bhaje**, and many tunes based on the melody of this composition. This composition was created by a well known musician composer Shri Muthuswami Dikshitar. It is widely believed that Raga Hamasadhwani was created by his musician father - Shri Ramaswami Dikshitar in the 18th century.

You may have already heard a brief of the Raga in my earlier post on [Story of Chandraveena](/blog/the-musical-story-of-chandraveena). Here I present an extensive Raga Alapana in Raga Hamsadhwani. This consists of three parts, Alap, Jod and Jhala also known as Ragam, Tanam.

## Program Notes

### Raga Alapana in Hamsadhwani
[Raga Alapana](/blog/raga-alapana) is an improvisation and a systematic presentation of a Raga. This part has no rhythmic accompaniment. It has three parts - Alap, Jod and Jhala. This format is also known as Ragam and Tanam.

Here are some notes about the Raga.

**Raga** - Hamsadhwani

**Scale** -  Sa Re Ga Pa Ni

**Family** - Kalyani (Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni)

**Melakarta** - Mechakalyani (Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni)

**Prahar** - 5th Prahar (6 pm - 9 pm)

### Reading the scale
In Indian Classical Music, the seven notes in an octave are called Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni and then Sa comes again. Notes with a capitalised first letter are called Tivra (or sharp) notes. E.g., Ga and Ni above. Notes written fully in lower case are called Komal (or flat) notes. There are no Komal or Flat notes in this Raga. Sa and Pa are always written with a capitalized first letter.

### Prahar
In Indian Classical Music, Ragas are classified into Prahars (time periods of a day or night) which are said to represent the most appropriate time to perform the Raga.
