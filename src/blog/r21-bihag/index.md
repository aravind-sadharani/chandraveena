Raga *Bihag* is a beautiful late evening / night Raga. There are two ways in which this Raga can be rendered. One version, which uses only Komal Madhyam, and a second version which uses both the Madhyams. In the latter version, the Tivra or the Sharp Madhyam is used as an *ati-shringar* (evoke a subtle emotion) *Hrasva* (subtle and short standing) note. Here I present Raga Bihag with both the Madhyams. The Scale of the Raga as I present is:

**Scale** - Sa Re Ga ma Ma Pa Dha Ni (refer to the Program Notes below for the notation).

As you can see from the scale above, the four semi-tones together (Ga ma Ma Pa) can pose quite a challenge. These notes are used in accordance with [Lakshanas and Lakshyas](/blog/grammar-of-music/) of the Raga, and not necessarily as a *Krama* (in order) contiuous set of notes.  *Tivra Rishabh* (**Re**) and *Tivra Dhaivat* (**Dha**) are used in an *Alpatva* (very subtle and not often used) way. 

It is one of the many Ragas which uses both the *Madhyams* - *Komal Madhyam* (**ma**) and *Tivra Madhyam* (**Ma**). This creates quite a dilemma with regard to classifying this Raga. I have chosen to take Raga Bihag as a *Janya* (derivative) raga of Melakarta Mechakalyani (Family Kalyani) based on my understanding and the way I have approached this Raga - though some musicologists classify it under Bilwal (Melakarta Shankarabharanam). 

In this presentation of *Raga Bihag* on Chandraveena, I present a Raga Alapana in three parts - Alap, Jod and Jhala also known as Alapana and Tanam. This Raga is commonly performed without Re and Dha. However, in this presentation, note the intricate usage of the two Madhyams, Rishabh and Dhaivat.

Enjoy the music!

## Program Notes

### Raga Alapana in Raga Bihag

[Raga Alapana](/blog/raga-alapana/) is an improvisation and a systematic presentation of a Raga. This part has no rhythmic accompaniment. It has three parts - Alap, Jod and Jhala. This format is also known as Ragam and Tanam.

Here are some notes about the Raga.

**Raga** - Bihag

**Scale** - Sa Re Ga ma Ma Pa Dha Ni

**Family** - Kalyani

**Melakarta** -  *Bhashang* *Janya* Raga of Mechakalyani (Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni)

**Prahar** - 6th Prahar (equivalent to 9 PM - 12 PM)

### Reading the scale
In Indian Classical Music, the seven notes in an octave are called Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni and then Sa comes again. Notes with a capitalised first letter are called Tivra (or sharp) notes. E.g., Re Ma above. Notes written fully in lower case are called Komal (or flat) notes E.g., ma above. Sa and Pa are always written with a capitalized first letter.

### Bhashanga Raga
A *Janya* (or derivative) Raga of a Melakarta which uses a note outside of the Melakarta notes. In this raga, ma (Komal Madhyam) is outside of Kalyani (Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni).

### Janya Raga
A *Janya* Raga is a derivative Raga from a parent Melakarta scale. The Janya Raga could be *Audav* (pentatonic), *Shadav* (hexatonic) or *Sampoorna* (heptatonic).

### Prahar
In Indian Classical Music, Ragas are classified into Prahars (time periods of a day or night) which are said to represent the most appropriate time to perform the Raga.
