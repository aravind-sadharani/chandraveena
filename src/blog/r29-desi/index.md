## What is Shruti Bhedam

All around the world, there are many different types of tuning system or ways to divide an octave. For eg, Equal Tempered, Just Intonation etc. Indian music, in its evolution, has always looked at natural phenomena as an inspiration. Taking cue, Octaves were divided based on intervals of naturally ocurring Fifths (Pancham Bhav), Fourths (Madhyam Bhav) and Major Third (Antara Gandharam).

*Shruti*, in our scriptures, has been defined as that sound which is heard immediately on exciting a note, without all the overtones/harmonics content. *Bhedam* is division into parts. *Shruti Bhedam* is division of a note into smaller parts. Why is this important? Because, subtle variations in the position of the note alters its character, the consonant intervals and therefore also has an impact on the musical patterns.

For eg, Raga Jaunpuri, and Raga Desi both have the same scale:

Sa Re ga ma Pa dha ni

To give a small example, the position of dha in Jaunpuri forms a Major Third (Antara Gandharam) interval with Sa (Shadaj), and therefore, `dha Sa` forms an important phrase. However, in Desi, position of dha is flatter, and therfore, it loses the Antara Gandharam interval. Hence, `dha` is an *andolita* swara, and the more common pattern is `Pa ni Sa` avoiding `dha Sa`. ga (which is consonant with dha) and dha are *vivadi* swaras.

Listen to both Raga Jaunpuri and Raga Desi rendition, and see if you can hear the similarities and the differences. Link to Raga Jaunpuri is given below in the Release Links section. You can also read about Raga Jaunpuri [here](/blog/r2-jaunpuri).


## Program Notes

Raga Desi belongs to the family of Asavari Ragas.  In this presentation of *Raga Desi* on Chandraveena, I explore the Raga in Alap, Jod and Jhala, followed by a Composition in Dhamar (14 beats). This Raga has some similarity to Raga Jaunpuri, and certain phrases bear some resemblance to Raga Sriragam as performed in Carnatic music.

This performance is accompanied by a very unique drone (Tanpura) accompaniment track. This drone track is synthesized from a project called [PureTones](https://puretones.sadharani.com), and developed by [Sadharani Music Works](https://www.sadharani.com). It has been microtonally adjusted to precisely suit the scale of the Raga. Note how the Drone along with its harmonics merge into the notes and phrases of the Raga. If it sounds interesting to you, be sure to check out [PureTones](https://puretones.sadharani.com). This Drone is freely available for your use. Get in touch with us if you need any assistance.

In this presentation of *Raga Desi* on Chandraveena, I am privileged to be accompanied by **Shri Sanjay Agle** on Pakhawaj for the Pallavi session. 

Shri Sanjay Agle is a master Pakhawaj player coming from a family and tradition of Pakhawaj players. His grandfather Ambadas Agle was a legendary pakhawaj player in the royal court of Indore. Sanjay Agle learnt from his father Kalidas Agle, and another renowned pakhawaj player Swami Pagaldas. I also had the pleasure of sitting down and chatting with him about his instrument and his craft.

### Alap in Raga Desi
Raga [Alapana](/blog/raga-alapana/) is an improvisation and a systematic presentation of a Raga. This part has no rhythmic accompaniment. Usually, it has three parts - Alap, Jod and Jhala. This format is also known as Ragam and Tanam. 

Here are some notes about the Raga and the Tala.

**Raga** - Desi

**Scale** - Sa Re ga ma Pa dha ni

**Family** - Asavari

**Melakarta** - Natabhairavi (Sa Re ga ma Pa dha ni)

**Prahar** - 2nd (equivalent to 9 AM - 12 PM)

### Pallavi (composition) in Raga Desi set to Dhamar
[Pallavi](/blog/pallavi/) also known as *Bandish*, *Gat*, *Kriti* or composition is a melodic line (or lines) bound by a [Tala](/blog/taladhyaya) or rhythmic cycle. In some cases, lyrics are set to a melody in the chosen Raga and Tala, whereas in other cases it is just a melodic line with no lyrical or literary meaning, called *Swarajati* or *Gat*. Many instrumental compositions use the latter format, to make the most of "playing" with the rhythm.

### Reading the scale
In Indian Classical Music, the seven notes in an octave are called Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni and then Sa comes again. Notes with a capitalised first letter are called Tivra (or sharp) notes. E.g., Re above. Notes written fully in lower case are called Komal (or flat) notes. E.g., ma and ni above. Sa and Pa are always written with a capitalized first letter.

### Prahar
In Indian Classical Music, Ragas are classified into Prahars (time periods of a day or night) which are said to represent the most appropriate time to perform the Raga.

### About the Tala
Dhamar has 14 beats split as 5 + 5 + 4 denoted by solfas or syllables representing various rhythmic patterns. The basic solfas of Dhamar are given below.

**Tala** - Dhamar

**Beats** - 14 (5+5+4)

**Solfas** - Dha Dhi Ta Dhi Ta | Dha Ghe Ghe Ti Ta | Ti Ta Ta NaNa |
In some styles the first solfa Dha (which is an open resonating sound) is replaced by Kat (a flat closed sound).
