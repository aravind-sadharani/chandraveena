Raga *Durga* is a very popular scale in Indian music. It is an *audava* or a pentatonic scale. This scale is also found in traditional music of Chinese and Japanese origin. This is also known as *Shuddha Saveri* in the South Indian music system. An interesting aspect of this scale lies in the fact that every *Murchhana* (also known as *Graha Bheda* or scale change) gives rise to another well known pentatonic scale. Take a look at these scales below.

* **Scale of main Raga (Raga Durga):** Sa Re ma Pa Dha (Please see Program Notes for nomenclature).
* **First Graha Bheda:** Re ma Pa Dha Sa. Transposing this to Sa, we get Sa ga ma Pa ni - *Dhani* or *Shuddha Dhanyasi*, also known as *minor pentatonic* in Western music.
* **Second Graha Bheda:** ma Pa Dha Sa Re. Transposing this to Sa, we get Sa Re Ga Pa Dha - *Bhoop* or *Mohanam*
* **Third Graha Bheda:** Pa Dha Sa Re ma. Transposing this back to Sa, we get Sa Re ma Pa ni - *Madhmadh* or *Madhyamadi* or *Madhyamavati*
* **Fourth Graha Bheda:** Dha Sa Re ma Pa. Transposing this to Sa, we get Sa ga ma dha ni - *Malkauns* or *Hindolam*

How remarkably cool is this! In Indian Classical Music, many ragas were derived as a murchhana of a scale. While in the earlier tradition of *Jati Gayan* (music of the Jati system), each scale started at different starting notes called *Graha Swara* (*Graha* means "home" and is also spelled as *Griha*, *Gruha*, etc), in the *Aadhara Shadaj* tradition of current times, all scales are sung to a single "home" or fundamental note, i.e, **Sa**.

**Confusion in the nomenclature of Shuddha Saveri**

I find the nomenclature *Shuddha Saveri* a bit confusing. Let me explain what i mean. In the Southern Indian system of *Swara* naming convention, the lowest position of a note in the 12 note scale is denoted as a *Shuddha* note. Now what that means is *Shuddha Re* means the lowest *re* or *komal re*. Now, there is a scale called *Saveri* whose *Swaras* are *Sa re ma Pa dha SA Ni dha Pa ma Ga re Sa*. As you can see, this scale already has the lowest re and dha or the *Shuddha re* and *Shuddha dha*. However, *Shuddha Saveri* has sharpened *re* and *dha*. On the other hand, in the North Indian nomenclature system, the sharper notes are called the *Shuddha* notes. Does it mean that the nomenclature *Shuddha Saveri* is a North Indian nomenclature? If so, then what is Durga?
Let me add some more confusion to this. There is a Raga called *Karnataka Shuddha Saveri*, which is called *Shuddha Saveri* according to the Dikshitar school of music, with the notes *Sa re ma Pa dha SA dha pa ma re Sa* - this is atleast consistent with the nomenclature convention but resembles *Saveri* rather than the currently accepted *Shuddha Saveri*.

Independent of the naming convention, Raga Durga is a very beautiful scale, and here I present a very detailed Alap. Using the consonant pairing of `Sa ma`, `Re Pa` and `ma Dha` makes this Raga very beautiful.

## Program Notes

### Short Alap in Raga Durga
[Raga Alapana](/blog/raga-alapana/) is an improvisation and a systematic presentation of a Raga. This part has no rhythmic accompaniment. Usually, it has three parts - Alap, Jod and Jhala. This format is also known as Ragam and Tanam. 

Here are some notes about the Raga.

**Raga** - Durga

**Scale** - Sa Re ma Pa Dha

**Family** - Shankarabharanam

**Melakarta** - Varjit (Ga, Ni) Janya Raga of 29th Melakarta Shankarabharanam (Sa Re Ga ma Pa Dha Ni)

**Prahar** - 3rd and 4th prahar (equivalent to 3 PM - 9 PM)

### Reading the scale
In Indian Classical Music, the seven notes in an octave are called Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni and then Sa comes again. Notes with a capitalised first letter are called Tivra (or sharp) notes. E.g., Re above. Notes written fully in lower case are called Komal (or flat) notes. E.g., ma above. Sa and Pa are always written with a capitalized first letter.

### Varjit Janya Raga
A Varjit Raga is a Janya (derived) Raga of a Melakarta (parent scale) in which one or more notes are dropped from the parent scale. In this case, Ga and Ni are dropped from the parent scale Shankarabharanam.

### Prahar
In Indian Classical Music, Ragas are classified into Prahars (time periods of a day or night) which are said to represent the most appropriate time to perform the Raga.|
